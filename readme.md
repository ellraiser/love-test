# L칬vetest
Basic testing suite for the [L칬ve](https://github.com/love2d/love) APIs, based off of [this issue](https://github.com/love2d/love/issues/1745).

Currently written for [L칬ve 12](https://github.com/love2d/love/tree/12.0-development), which is still in development.

> The following modules are not covered as we can't really emulate input nicely:  
> `joystick`, `keyboard`, `mouse`, and `touch`

## Running Tests
The testsuite aims to keep things as simple as possible, and just runs all the tests inside L칬ve to match how they'd be used by developers in-engine.
To run the tests, download the repo and then run the main.lua as you would a L칬ve game, i.e:

WINDOWS: `& 'c:\Program Files\LOVE\love.exe' PATH_TO_TESTING_FOLDER --console`  
MACOS: `/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love PATH_TO_TESTING_FOLDER`  
LINUX: `./love.AppImage PATH_TO_TESTING_FOLDER`

By default all tests will be run for all modules.  
If you want to specify a module/s you can use:  
`--runSpecificModules filesystem,audio`  
If you want to specify only 1 specific method only you can use:  
`--runSpecificMethod filesystem write`

All results will be printed in the console per method as PASS, FAIL, or SKIP with total assertions met on a module level and overall level.  

When finished, the following files will be generated in the `/output` directory with a summary of the test results:
- an `XML` file in the style of [JUnit XML](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/developer-for-zos/14.1?topic=formats-junit-xml-format)
- a `HTML` file that shows any visual test results
- a `Markdown` file for use with [this github action](https://github.com/ellraiser/love-test-report)
> An example of all types of output can be found in the `/examples`  
> The visual results of any graphic tests can be found in `/output/actual`

---

## Architecture
Each method and object has it's own test method written in `/tests` under the matching module name.

When you run the tests, a single TestSuite object is created which handles the progress + totals for all the tests.  
Each module has a TestModule object created, and each test method has a TestMethod object created which keeps track of assertions for that method. You can currently do the following assertions:
- **assertNotNil**(value)
- **assertEquals**(expected, actual, label)
- **assertNotEquals**(expected, actual, label)
- **assertRange**(actual, min, max, label)
- **assertMatch**({option1, option2, option3 ...}, actual, label) 
- **assertGreaterEqual**(expected, actual, label)
- **assertLessEqual**(expected, actual, label)
- **assertObject**(table)
- **assertPixels**(imgdata, pixeltable, label)
- **assertCoords**(expected, actual, label)

Example test method:
```lua
-- love.filesystem.read test method
-- all methods should be put under love.test.MODULE.METHOD, matching the API
love.test.filesystem.read = function(test)
  -- setup any data needed then run any asserts using the passed test object
  local content, size = love.filesystem.read('resources/test.txt')
  test:assertNotNil(content)
  test:assertEquals('helloworld', content, 'check content match')
  test:assertEquals(10, size, 'check size match')
  content, size = love.filesystem.read('resources/test.txt', 5)
  test:assertNotNil(content)
  test:assertEquals('hello', content, 'check content match')
  test:assertEquals(5, size, 'check size match')
  -- no need to return anything or cleanup, GCC is called after each method
end
```

Each test is run inside it's own coroutine, meaning you can use `coroutine.yield(frames)` to pause the test for a small period if you need to check things that won't happen for a few seconds

After each test method is ran, the assertions are totalled up, printed, and we move onto the next method! Once all methods in the suite are run a total pass/fail/skip is given for that module and we move onto the next module (if any)

For sanity-checking, if it's currently not covered or it's not possible to test the method we can set the test to be skipped with `test:skipTest(reason)` - this way we still see the method listed in the test output without it affected the pass/fail totals

## Todo 
Modules with some small bits needed or needing sense checking:
- **love.event** - love.event.wait or love.event.pump need writing if possible I dunno how to check
- **love.font** - newBMFontRasterizer() wiki entry is wrong so not sure whats expected
- **love.graphics** - still need to do tests for the main drawing methods
- **love.image** - ideally isCompressed should have an example of all compressed files love can take
- **love.*.objects** - all objects tests still to be done
- **love.graphics.setStencilTest** - deprecated, replaced by setStencilMode()

---

## Future Goals
- [ ] Tests can compare visual results to a reference image (partially done)
- [ ] Ability to test loading different combinations of modules
- [ ] Performance tests
